How to run the simplipc test:

After compiling this code using make install you will need to
open 2 consoles to run the tests.

On console 1: logged onto $SIMPL_HOME/simplipc/bin
	receiver -n BOBR
		where BOBR - is an arbitrary name you which to
				name attach receiver to

On console 2: logged onto $SIMPL_HOME/simplipc/bin
	sender -n BOBS -r BOBR -m "hello world"
		where
			-n BOBS - is name to attach sender to
			-r BOBR - is name used in 1) above
			-m <msg> - is the string you wish to send 

	or

	sender -n BOBS -r BOBR -p 33
		where
			-n BOBS - is name to attach sender to
			-r BOBR - is name used in 1) above
			-p <proxy> - is the proxy value you wish to send


What happens is that both processes attach to their respective names.
The sender then locates receiver and sends the message.  In the case of the
-m option the sender uses the blocking send to pass the message and blocks
until the receiver replies.

In the case of the -p option the sender uses the non blocking proxy send
and does not wait for the receiver to reply.
