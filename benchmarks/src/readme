How to run the benchmark code:

After compiling this code using make install you will need to
open 2 consoles to run the tests.

On console 1: logged onto $SIMPL_HOME/benchmarks/bin
	receiver -n BOBR
		where BOBR - is an arbitrary name you which to
				name attach receiver to

On console 2: logged onto $SIMPL_HOME/benchmarks/bin
	sender -n BOBS -r BOBR -t 60000 -s 1024
		where
			-n BOBS - is name to attach sender to
			-r BOBR - is name used in 1) above
			-t 60000 - means send 60000 messages before
				displaying timing
			-s 1024 - make each message 1024 bytes in length
				(same size for replies)

What happens is that sender locates receiver and then marks the time.
It then procedes to send a bunch of messages to the receiver each time
blocking for the same size reply.  When the command line determined number
of messages have been exchanged the sender calculates and reports the
total elapsed time in msec.
